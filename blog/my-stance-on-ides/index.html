I kept using <code>Eclipse</code>, I definetely lost hours through compilation, or by using the basic components of an IDE, such as going to the definition of a Java method, or implementing getters and setters.<h2 id=a-way-out>A way out?</h2><p>And then. In 2017, I started watching anoher Minecraft developer, he was typing fast, his IDE looked great, and it looked like it was performant.<p>I proceeded to download <code>IntelliJ</code>.<p>And already, the bugs that <code>Eclipse</code> had, were no more. It was still slow on my computer, but it was a great progress, I could code faster.<p>But what made me fall in love with <code>IntelliJ</code> is the design, I never took the time to customize my <code>Eclipse</code> experience.<p>I had better performances, I had a nice background image on my code, the file icons looked great, thanks to the discovery of this new IDE, I definitely felt back in love with development, the spark rekindled.<h2 id=entering-university>Entering University</h2><p>I entered <code>EPITECH</code> in 2020, and during a whole month I did not use <code>IntelliJ</code> or any other IDEs.<p>We were learning the <code>C</code> programming language by reading <code>man</code> pages, and using <code>emacs</code>, having no <code>language server</code> installed.<p><em>For those who don‚Äôt know what a <code>language server</code> is, it‚Äôs a tool bundled in IDEs that will act as a <code>middleware</code> between your code and the features of the language. Its simplest role can be of <code>syntax highlighting</code>, or also look for the use of variables, classes. etc</em><p>Even though I had the features of a basic text editor, apart from <code>refactoring</code> my variables or structure names, I felt like I was coding faster than with an <code>IDE</code> running slowly on my computer.<p>I also didn‚Äôt feel the need for any <code>file tree</code>.<h2 id=the-relapse>The relapse</h2><p>Though, once I finished the month with the basic text editor, I installed <code>VSCode</code>, and felt a ‚Äúrelief‚Äù.<h2 id=hope>Hope?</h2><p>In 2021, I learnt about the <code>vim</code> editor, I heard that ‚Äúevery cool dev‚Äù, were using it.<p>So I decided to give it a try, but I felt like it was too hard, and not intuitive enough, so I gave up using it.<h2 id=actual-hope>Actual hope</h2><p>Around 2022, I was getting really ‚Äúlinux-nerdy‚Äù, I also wanted to use the lightest programs for everything, to save my laptop‚Äôs battery, so instead of having only 3-4 hours of battery, I‚Äôd increase it to 6-7 hours.<p>I also became a big fan of the <code>Rust</code> programming language, and by looking for programs made in <code>Rust</code> on GitHub, I stumbled across <code>helix-editor</code>, a <code>vim</code> like editor, purely made in Rust.<p>I decided to give <code>vim</code> programs another shot. And I‚Äôm grateful that I did!<p>It was actuall way more intuitive than <code>vim</code>, and the <code>language servers</code> were already pre-installed.<p><em>At the time of writing this post, <code>vim distros</code>, which install a version of <code>vim</code> with many bundled plugins, and language servers, are really famous, but I hadn‚Äôt heard of any of them in 2022.</em><p>So I stuck with it.<h2 id=now>Now?</h2><p>To this day, <code>IntelliJ</code>, remains my favorite IDE, and the one that I will use whenever I‚Äôd do Java programming.<p>But by using the <code>helix-editor</code> <em>(which I‚Äôm currently writing the blog with)</em>, I feel like my laptop is thanking me, and that my development workflow became better, and way faster.<p>Especially on laptops, I feel like using the touchpad is a big loss of time, mouses on computers are still fine, but not having to move your hands at all, and keep your hands on your keyboard is an amazing thing.<h2 id=recommendations>Recommendations</h2><p>I don‚Äôt recommend beginners in programming the use of editors like <code>vim</code>, they should learn the language itself first, and once they feel confident with it, they can use <code>helix-editor</code> or any <code>vim</code> distros.<p>And then, once they feel at ease with coding on <code>vim</code> they can fully customize it.<h2 id=rust-programming>Rust programming</h2><p>Regarding the <code>Rust</code> programming language, there‚Äôs currently <code>RustRover</code> made by <code>Jetbrains</code>, the creators of <code>IntelliJ</code>, in <code>Preview</code>, I used it for three good months, but I had to stop.<p>Even though I have a really good laptop nowadays, when using <code>RustRover</code> my computer lasts at most 2 hours, and is using 4-6GB of RAM just for the <code>IDE</code>, that‚Äôs crazy.<p>I also tried out <code>lapce</code>, an editor made in <code>Rust</code>, and it‚Äôs actually great! But it lacks stability, if you want to use it, please wait at least some months, maybe a year, until it becomes more stable.<p class=tagsData><a href=/tags/thoughts>/thoughts/</a> <a href=/tags/development>/development/</a></main><footer><hr><div class=footContainer><div><a href=https://512kb.club><img alt="a proud member of the green team of 512KB club" src=https://512kb.club/assets/images/green-team.svg></a></div><div><a title="250KB Club page" href=https://250kb.club/paulcomte-cafe> <img alt="badge: proud member of the 250KB Club" src=https://250kb.club/color_badge_dark.png> </a></div><div><a href=https://www.cutercounter.com/ target=_blank> <img alt="visitor counter" src="https://www.cutercounter.com/hits.php?id=hexpdofn&nd=1&style=1" border=0> </a></div></div></footer></div>
