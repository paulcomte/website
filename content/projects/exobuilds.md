## Introduction

During 2022, I used to play `League of Legends` with my friends, and they recommended me to use website to get the best champion builds.

A really famous one is [U.GG](https://U.GG).

> For those who are not yet introduced to this game, you can get more informations [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends).

I was looking for project ideas to code on my spare time, and the idea of working on such website really enjoyed me.

## Tech stack
 - Programming language: Rust
 - Web-server framework: rocket.rs
 - Database: MongoDB

## The journey

First thing first was to set up a default web server, I therefore followed the [rocket.rs getting started guide](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/getting-started/)

Then I looked for available Riot Games API wrappers in Rust, but I could not find any.
