## Introduction

### Project definition

This project was an `EPITECH` project, the project was defined as followed:

 - A client interface
 - TCP communication between the client and the server
 - UDP communication between two clients
 - Send messages to another client
 - Retrieve client conversation (messages sent and received)

### Tech stack
 - Programming language: C++
 - Window library: Qt
 - Server library: asio

### The journey

During this project I wanted to have lots of fun, and on top of the mandatory features, implement other features that to me, should be available on every real-time messaging and voice app.

Regarding the interface I decided to take the Discord interface for idea.

This was the first ever project where I started by working on the frontend, whereas my usual habit would be to work on the backend.

I wanted to have a clearer view of the result I wanted to provide, and also improve my frontend skills.

And actually, starting by working on the frontend was a good choice for two main reasons:

 - I did know in advance what features I would have on the client, so no time lost on the backend with unimplemented features on the client-side.
 - I lost a precious time trying to compile the frontend, so if I hard to work on the frontend after the backend I might had not forseen this and I'd be unable to implement all features in time.

- ## Frontend architecture

> ### Scenes
 - #### Left layout
    - User: `Icon | Username | Logout`
    - Contact: `for contact in contacts => contactBox(contact)`
    - Search: `Text input`
 - #### Right layout
    - Chat info scene: `CallUp/HangUp Buttons`
    - Chat scene: `for message in messages => messageBox(message)`
    - Chat box scene: `Text input`

> ### Event system

An event system has to be implemented for the following cases:

 - When the user would interact on the client, such as changing the selected contact, or looking for a contact by its name
 - When the server would send a packet to the client.

#### List of implemented events

 - LOGIN_FAILED
 - LOGOUT
 - CONTACT_FILTER_UPDATE
 - NEW_CONTACT
 - NEW_BULK_CONTACT
 - NEW_MESSAGE
 - NEW_BULK_MESSAGE
 - NEW_CLIENT
 - NEW_CHATTING
 - CALL_STATE_UPDATE

## Backend architecture

> ### Database system

Every message, and user would be saved on a database.

> ### PacketHandler system

This system would perform the following steps:

1. Deserialize the packet
2. Call the the handler for this packet

> ### TCP

Each client connected to the server has a `Transporter`

## Difficulties

In this project I encountered a major difficulty, which was with the compilation of the project on the linux distribution `NixOS`, I lost a lot of time.

I also faced another difficulty, that I sadly could not resolve, the audio library in C++ seems like to not work on Linux, therefore I can only compile the client on Windows if I enable the voice call feature...

## Protocol system

One of the fundamental point in this project was the protocol system.

It needed to be as flexible and ergonomic as possible.

I implemented a protocol system which I got so proud of that I wrote an article to explain how I proceedeed, if you want more details, feel free to click [here](/blog/a-protocol-system).

## Features

 - The icon of an user is generated from his username
 - Messages are stacked until `x` amount of time has passed, or `x` amount of messages has been sent.

## Limitations

Due to the limitations of my architecture, as it wasn't thought in time, and I didn't have time to refactor, the history of messages will only stack if the user switches to another conversation.
