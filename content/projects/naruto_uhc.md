## Introduction
I was contacted by a friend around August 2020, to work on a Minecraft project, a custom UHC game mode.

The `NarutoUHC` game mode.

I was getting kind of busy as it was soon the beginning of my first year of studies at `EPITECH`, therefore, I declined my friends' offer, and recommended him another developer.

Unfortunately, my friend paid that developer, and during three months we didn't get any news from him, so I pressured the developer into refunding my friend, otherwise I would go and take legal actions.

Fortunately, during mid-December, the developer refunded my friend, and as it was getting towards the end of my first semester, I decided to work on the project instead.

I began working on it on the 8th of January 2021.[^1]

## Project details

The project uses the following:
 - Java 8 - JDK 8
 - Spigot 1.8.9 library
