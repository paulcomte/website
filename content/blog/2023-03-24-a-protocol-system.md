## Introduction

During the realization of the `Babel` project, I had to work on a protocol system, to enable interactions between the client and the server.

If you want more details about the base project, feel free to click [here](/projects/babel).

## Tech stack
 - Programming language: C++

> The protocol system does not depend on anything else.

## Future ?

If I ever get the time to work on my protocol system, I would definitely write a file parser to create packets from simple json files
